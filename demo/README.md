# Demo pipelines

These demo pipelines are available to demonstrate a valuable structure of a pipeline.

Running a demo pipeline with the Flow CLI utility (requires `mage`):

1. Clone and `cd` into the Flow project: `git clone git@github.com:munichbughunter/flow.git && cd flow`
2. Compile the flow CLI: `mage build`
3. Run the pipeline: `./bin/flow ./demo/{demo}`.

Running a demo pipeline without the Flow CLI:

1. Clone and `cd` into the Flow project: `git clone git@github.com:munichbughunter/flow.git && cd flow`
2. Run the pipeline: `PIPELINE=./demo/{pipeline} go run -path=$PIPELINE $PIPELINE`

## [`./basic`](./basic)

This basic pipeline creates a single pipeline which runs many common steps that most projects might have.

## [`./complex`](./complex)

This more complex pipeline creates a single pipeline which runs many steps with logs and timeouts. It has many steps and demonstrates a maintainable approach to writing large pipelines and steps that use structured logging and traces.

## [`./custom-client`](./custom-client)

This program creates a very simple pipeline but with a new custom client available.

Use the `-client=my-custom-client` to run the pipeline with the custom client.
